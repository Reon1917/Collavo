# Logout Issue - Root Cause Found & Fixed âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

The logout issue wasn't with the logout logic - it was a **trusted origins configuration problem**!

### Error Analysis
```
ERROR [Better Auth]: Invalid origin: http://localhost:3001
INFO [Better Auth]: If it's a valid URL, please add http://localhost:3001 to trustedOrigins in your auth config
Current list of trustedOrigins: http://localhost:3000,https://collavo-alpha.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
POST /api/auth/sign-out 403 in 35ms
```

**The Problem:**
- User was running on `localhost:3001` 
- Better Auth only trusted `localhost:3000`
- All signOut requests were getting **403 Forbidden**

## âœ… **SIMPLE FIX APPLIED**

### 1. **Added localhost:3001 to Trusted Origins**
```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
trustedOrigins: [
  "http://localhost:3000",
  "http://localhost:3001", // âœ… Added for development flexibility
  "https://collavo-alpha.vercel.app",
  // ... other origins
]
```

### 2. **Reverted Complex Logout Logic**
Since the issue was just the trusted origin, reverted back to the simple, clean logout:

```typescript
// components/ui/dashboard-navbar.tsx
const handleLogout = async (): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    await authClient.signOut();
    await refetch();
    router.push('/');
    toast.success('Logged out successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error);
    toast.error('Failed to logout');
  }
};
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **RESULT**

**Logout now works perfectly!**

- âœ… **Simple & clean** logout implementation
- âœ… **Supports both** `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001`
- âœ… **No complex fallbacks** needed
- âœ… **Better Auth works** as intended

## ðŸ§  **LESSON LEARNED**

**Always check the basics first:**
1. Network errors (403 Forbidden)
2. Configuration issues (trusted origins)
3. Environment mismatches (ports)

**Before implementing complex workarounds!**

The original error logs clearly showed the issue - Better Auth was rejecting the origin. A simple configuration change fixed everything.

**Logout is now working perfectly on both localhost:3000 and localhost:3001! ðŸŽ‰**
