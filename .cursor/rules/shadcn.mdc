A param property was accessed directly with `params.id`. `params` is now a Promise and should be unwrapped with `React.use()` before accessing properties of the underlying params object. In this version of Next.js direct access to param properties is still supported to facilitate migration but in a future version you will be required to unwrap `params` with `React.use()`.
